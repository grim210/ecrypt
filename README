This project is meant to implement a lot of strong cryptographic standards
while also being easy to use, easy to read and easy to audit.  It uses
standard libraries where possible, and attempts to encapsulate and separate
code as best as possible.

Feel free to help!  If you find mistakes, please let me know and I will fix
them when I get time.  Try to avoid excessive optimization.  As stated above,
I'm trying to make it easy to read and understand.

It should be worth saying that I don't claim responsibility for any loss or
damage of property from using this code.  I'm an amateur in every way to
cryptography, so use this software at your own risk.

For licensing requirements, see the COPYING file of the root directory of the
project.
